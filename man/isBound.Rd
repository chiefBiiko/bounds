\title{Check whether a function is bound to its enclosure}
\usage{
isBound(func)
}
\arguments{
\item{func}{Function to check \strong{required}.}
}
\value{
Logical indicating whether \code{func} is bound, a closure.
}
\description{
\code{isBound} scans its input function's frame checking if there are any 
names not bound within its own scope - free variables. It returns a logical value 
indicating whether the input function is bound, aka a closure.
}
\details{
\code{isBound(func)} translates to: Is \code{func} bound to any 
names in its enclosing environment? \code{isBound} always returns 
\code{FALSE} for primitives since these do not have an environment.
}
\examples{
isBound(sum)
one_plus <- bind(sum, 1L)
isBound(one_plus)
